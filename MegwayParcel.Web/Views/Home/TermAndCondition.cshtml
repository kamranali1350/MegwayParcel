                        10.1. No insurance will be effected except upon express written instructions from the Customer. Without choosing additional coverage, you are covered for goods valued up to £50, or 2SDR per kilo (whichever is greater), for all services except for the following. For our EVRi, Landmark Global and USPS services, you are covered up to £25 or 2SDR per kilo. For Transglobal Next Day, you are covered up to £100.
                        We strongly recommend you read these terms and opt for additional cover if required. Insurance cover is non-refundable once the shipment has been collected or dropped off.
                        Claims must be made directly to Megway Parcels Ltd. Any attempt to claim with the carrier directly will invalidate your claim with us.
                        A claim can only be made by the person or company contracted with Megway Parcels Ltd; that is, the account holder, not the receiver.
                        A claim for lost or damaged goods will be rejected if the items claimed for are missing from the original valued customs invoice or if the items claimed for are on our list of "Dangerous, Hazardous and Prohibited", or "No Compensation" items.
                        For more detailed insurance terms and conditions, please see our Insurance Information guide.
